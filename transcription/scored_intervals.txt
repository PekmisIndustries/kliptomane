2.60 | [36.00 - 38.00] And now Zazel possesses the peau et le corps de Zara in the most cruel of manners.
0.94 | [38.00 - 40.00] I think that's right.

2.32 | [393.00 - 395.00] Look at some countries that taste the eggs like that
0.92 | [395.00 - 397.00] The French authorities have not yet made any progress in the field of the protection of the environment.

1.54 | [10224.46 - 10226.46] I'm going to go down the middle lane
1.77 | [10226.46 - 10228.46] It doesn't make sense to be with her.
0.47 | [10228.46 - 10230.46] So it is not her head

1.03 | [10254.46 - 10256.46] - What ?
1.55 | [10256.46 - 10262.52] Because normally when the coup comes he wouldn't be on a train to have sex with another man.
0.30 | [10266.52 - 10271.02] You can't reach these levels because you want to play more on the parcours suites.

1.16 | [10864.76 - 10866.76] It's a German chant of the guard.
1.95 | [10866.76 - 10868.76] It's like singing the merchandise
2.80 | [10868.76 - 10870.76] Look at you .

1.17 | [10934.76 - 10936.76] I'm not sure.
2.83 | [10936.76 - 10938.76] I know what I'm doing.
0.53 | [10938.76 - 10940.76] I don't have much of a PvP.
0.64 | [10940.76 - 10942.76] Bah tu sais
2.72 | [10942.76 - 10944.76] I'm not a fan of the 1.8
1.56 | [10944.76 - 10946.76] The Commission shall adopt the following measures:
1.17 | [10946.76 - 10948.76] I'm not sure.
3.14 | [10948.76 - 10950.76] I know it 's not true .
3.59 | [10950.76 - 10952.76] But one day she told me
0.94 | [10952.76 - 10954.76] He's sorry for me because he's real.
0.86 | [10954.76 - 10956.76] It's thanks to the fact that I'm a pop that you win so much
2.80 | [10956.76 - 10958.76] I really want to be a MC 1.8
1.04 | [10958.76 - 10960.76] You see really
2.46 | [10960.76 - 10962.76] What to do
2.23 | [10962.76 - 10964.76] So you're worried.
3.84 | [10964.76 - 10966.76] I can tell you that no joke
0.51 | [10966.76 - 10968.76] Take a computer fixed c'est mieux
1.19 | [10968.76 - 10970.76] Oh , yeah .
3.17 | [10970.76 - 10972.76] A fixed computer a combien parce que pour faire le pvp 1.8 c'est combien
2.59 | [10972.76 - 10974.76] Pff 900 balls
0.46 | [10974.76 - 10976.76] In fact it's not bad.
0.94 | [10976.76 - 10978.76] In fact
0.34 | [10978.76 - 10980.76] But in fact it's the same as paying 900 bullets when you're a Mac and an Xbox.
2.31 | [10980.76 - 10982.76] In this case , brother .
2.24 | [10982.76 - 10984.76] Mais tu peux jouer √† minecraft sur mac

0.87 | [10992.76 - 10994.76] With a ton of shit
1.11 | [10994.76 - 10996.76] Not in fact
1.60 | [10996.76 - 10998.76] No joke I think that
0.68 | [10998.76 - 11000.76] The amount of the contribution
1.21 | [11000.76 - 11002.76] But the problem is you won't want to install another game.
3.11 | [11002.76 - 11004.76] And if you get 900 euros, you're dead.
0.53 | [11004.76 - 11006.76] After what you can do instead of hiding us
0.22 | [11006.76 - 11008.76] That's what you're looking for the name of the game
0.46 | [11008.76 - 11010.76] Config recommand√©
0.53 | [11010.76 - 11012.76] You consider the recommendation
1.19 | [11012.76 - 11014.76] And you consider how much it costs
1.23 | [11014.76 - 11016.76] In fact, yes, too.
0.63 | [11016.76 - 11018.76] That's just it.
3.16 | [11018.76 - 11020.76] You know what I mean.
2.38 | [11020.76 - 11022.76] Otherwise I've got an old computer but you're gonna

0.88 | [11026.76 - 11028.76] Oh my cousin
3.03 | [11028.76 - 11030.76] Ah he went to school if he was to pass in the desert
1.19 | [11030.76 - 11032.76] The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a regulation on the implementation of the Community's financial instruments.
0.56 | [11032.76 - 11034.76] The genre is "plus high"
2.12 | [11034.76 - 11036.76] Oh , you son of a bitch .
1.96 | [11036.76 - 11038.76] But look at me

2.64 | [11042.76 - 11044.76] The man is dead
0.54 | [11044.76 - 11046.76] A quel moment
1.59 | [11046.76 - 11048.76] I am really interested in the genre

0.47 | [11050.76 - 11052.76] But I do it like that to get the two of them together.
1.68 | [11052.76 - 11054.76] I will listen to you
0.61 | [11054.76 - 11056.76] You said you'd be the one to comment on it.
2.07 | [11056.76 - 11058.76] What is it?
0.65 | [11058.76 - 11060.76] The screen doesn't move past my columns
0.87 | [11060.76 - 11062.76] Rides
0.56 | [11062.76 - 11064.76] I'm not going to play there.
0.30 | [11064.76 - 11066.76] I know even more than what I do in the game
1.05 | [11066.76 - 11068.76] What ?
0.87 | [11068.76 - 11070.76] Rides
0.87 | [11070.76 - 11072.76] Rides
0.45 | [11072.76 - 11074.76] It's for the living
0.86 | [11074.76 - 11076.76] But I'm sure we'll vote yes.
0.87 | [11076.76 - 11078.76] Rides
1.11 | [11078.76 - 11080.76] Not in fact
0.37 | [11080.76 - 11082.76] In fact if you take a computer you must invest directly because
2.34 | [11082.76 - 11084.76] But yes , brother .
2.22 | [11084.76 - 11086.76] 900 ‚Ç¨ for a tonne of computer
2.36 | [11086.76 - 11088.76] Le plus bien fr√®re
0.43 | [11088.76 - 11090.76] Take just a good computer and voil√† fr√®re
2.13 | [11090.76 - 11092.76] But the problem is to get a good computer that costs nothing.
2.56 | [11092.76 - 11094.76] It is very expensive.
2.56 | [11094.76 - 11096.76] It is very expensive.
0.68 | [11096.76 - 11098.76] I know what that means.
0.81 | [11098.76 - 11100.76] It's the arc of pain brother it's a good chance
1.56 | [11100.76 - 11102.76] I'm not a fake.

0.48 | [11104.76 - 11106.76] Xbox, Mac and all
0.99 | [11106.76 - 11108.76] You put me on a GG to play because I've really been a dog
1.78 | [11110.76 - 11112.76] I'm going to get a GG crash.
1.44 | [11112.76 - 11114.76] In fact I'm going to go to my couch
1.56 | [11114.76 - 11116.76] The Commission shall adopt the following measures:
0.38 | [11116.76 - 11118.76] Tiens prends ton GG
2.30 | [11118.76 - 11120.76] I have no right to be

0.92 | [11146.76 - 11148.76] Good question NordX
2.03 | [11148.76 - 11150.76] You'd have to tell me you'd be here.

0.38 | [11180.76 - 11182.76] That's what I'm saying.
0.29 | [11182.76 - 11184.76] It's all about the party.
1.00 | [11184.76 - 11186.76] You drink a lot of alcohol and you make the party
