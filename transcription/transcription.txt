[819.00 - 821.00] Ah ah ah
[821.00 - 823.00] - I'm not going to.
[823.00 - 825.00] There's a hole in the cave.

[10892.76 - 10894.76] Ah ah ah ah
[10894.76 - 10896.76] I've even not reacted.
[10896.76 - 10898.76] Not really, it's for minecraft.
[10898.76 - 10900.76] Ah, well, I guess if you take it for the PC, it's to play with the mods.

[10930.76 - 10932.76] I'm sorry for the way you're doing.
[10932.76 - 10934.76] Not for the pvp 1.8
[10934.76 - 10936.76] I'm not sure.
[10936.76 - 10938.76] I know what I'm doing.
[10938.76 - 10940.76] I don't have much of a PvP.
[10940.76 - 10942.76] Bah tu sais
[10942.76 - 10944.76] I'm not a fan of the 1.8
[10944.76 - 10946.76] The Commission shall adopt the following measures:
[10946.76 - 10948.76] I'm not sure.
[10948.76 - 10950.76] I know it 's not true .
[10950.76 - 10952.76] But one day she told me
[10952.76 - 10954.76] He's sorry for me because he's real.
[10954.76 - 10956.76] It's thanks to the fact that I'm a pop that you win so much
[10956.76 - 10958.76] I really want to be a MC 1.8
[10958.76 - 10960.76] You see really
[10960.76 - 10962.76] What to do
[10962.76 - 10964.76] So you're worried.
[10964.76 - 10966.76] I can tell you that no joke
[10966.76 - 10968.76] Take a computer fixed c'est mieux
[10968.76 - 10970.76] Oh , yeah .
[10970.76 - 10972.76] A fixed computer a combien parce que pour faire le pvp 1.8 c'est combien
[10972.76 - 10974.76] Pff 900 balls
[10974.76 - 10976.76] In fact it's not bad.
[10976.76 - 10978.76] In fact
[10978.76 - 10980.76] But in fact it's the same as paying 900 bullets when you're a Mac and an Xbox.
[10980.76 - 10982.76] In this case , brother .
[10982.76 - 10984.76] Mais tu peux jouer à minecraft sur mac
[10984.76 - 10986.76] In this case , brother .
[10986.76 - 10988.76] You play minecraft playstation 4 and you make us not cry
[10988.76 - 10990.76] On the va te faire chier
[10990.76 - 10992.76] I've censored the game there

[10994.76 - 10996.76] Not in fact
[10996.76 - 10998.76] No joke I think that
[10998.76 - 11000.76] The amount of the contribution
[11000.76 - 11002.76] But the problem is you won't want to install another game.
[11002.76 - 11004.76] And if you get 900 euros, you're dead.
[11004.76 - 11006.76] After what you can do instead of hiding us
